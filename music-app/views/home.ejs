            <p>
              Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. (born September 27, 1982),[2] known
              professionally as Lil Wayne, is an American rapper, singer,
              songwriter, and record executive. He is regarded by many
              contemporaries as one of the most influential hip hop artists of his
              generation,[3] and often cited as one of the greatest rappers of all
              time.[4][5] His career began in 1995, at the age of 12, when he was
              signed by rapper Birdman, joining Cash Money Records as the youngest
              member of the label.[6] From then on, Wayne was the flagship artist of
              Cash Money Records before ending his association with the company in
              June 2018.[7]

              In 1995, Wayne was put in a duo with label-mate B.G. (at the time
              known as Lil Doogie) and they recorded an album, True Story, released
              that year, although Wayne (at the time known as Baby D) only appeared
              on three tracks.[8] Wayne and B.G. soon joined the southern hip hop
              group Hot Boys, with Cash Money label-mates Juvenile and Turk in 1997;
              they released their debut album Get It How U Live! in October that
              year. The Hot Boys became popular following the release of the album
              Guerrilla Warfare (1999) and the song "Bling Bling".

              Lil Wayne's solo debut album Tha Block Is Hot (1999) was his solo
              breakthrough, and he reached higher popularity with his fourth album
              Tha Carter (2004) and fifth album Tha Carter II (2005), as well as
              several mixtapes and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007. He
              gained more prominence within the music industry with his sixth album
              Tha Carter III (2008), with first-week sales of over one million
              copies in the US. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album
              and included successful singles "A Milli", "Got Money" (featuring
              T-Pain), and "Lollipop" (featuring Static Major)—the latter being his
              first single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In February
              2010, Wayne released his seventh studio album, Rebirth, which
              experimented with rap rock and was met with generally negative
              reviews. A month later in March 2010, Lil Wayne began serving an
              8-month jail sentence in New York after being convicted of criminal
              possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. His
              eighth studio album I Am Not a Human Being (2010) was released during
              his incarceration, while his 2011 album Tha Carter IV was released
              following his release. Tha Carter IV sold 964,000 copies in its first
              week in the United States.[9] His twelfth studio album Tha Carter V
              was released in 2018 after multiple delays. Wayne's thirteenth album,
              Funeral, was released in early 2020.[10]

              Lil Wayne has sold over 120 million records worldwide, including more
              than 20 million albums and 70 million digital tracks in the United
              States, making him one of the world's best-selling music
              artists.[11][12][13] He has won five Grammy Awards, 11 BET Awards,
              four Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and eight
              NAACP Image Awards. On September 27, 2012, he became the first male
              artist to surpass Elvis Presley with the most entries on the Billboard
              Hot 100, with 109 songs.[14][15] Lil Wayne also currently serves as
              the chief executive officer (CEO) of his own label, Young Money
              Entertainment.
